    "The handler ignores critical errors during request parsing, which can hide failures.",
    "Unchecked type assertions can panic when request fields are missing or have wrong types.",
    "Input validation is missing for required fields and numeric constraints.",
    "Balance updates should use transactional logic for correctness in financial operations.",
    "The endpoint returns success regardless of failure conditions, reducing observability for callers."
