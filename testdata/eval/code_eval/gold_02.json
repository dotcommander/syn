  "key_insights": [
    "The endpoint lacks request validation, allowing invalid or unsafe transfer inputs.",
    "Transfer operations must be wrapped in a database transaction to prevent partial updates.",
    "Concurrent balance updates require locking or equivalent safeguards to avoid race conditions.",
    "Authorization must verify the caller can initiate the transfer.",
    "Business rules like positive amount and sufficient funds are not enforced."
